# Week-1-Challenge
This repository holds the HTML and CSS code to a website called Horiseon. Horiseon has developed a website which explains the important strategies used in
expanding a business' online presence.

## What was the motivation?

This website was in need of some changes to its code structure in both HTML and CSS files. The changes for the HTML file are listed below:
>
>- Added a more descriptive title inside the title element
>- Added alt descriptions to all images that appear on the webpage, to give them priority in appearing in google searches
>- Changed div element to header element for better clarity
>- Changed div element to nav element for better clarity
>- Changed div element to main element
>- Changed div to section and gave all sections a common classThe section element displays a particular section on the webpage
>- Changed div element to aside element for the sidebarThe aside element can be used to display a section that is placed on either side of the webpage
>- Changed div to section and gave all sections a common class
>- Changed div element to footer element

Here are the changes to the CSS file:
>
>- Changed header from a class to an element, this was repeated for all classes starting with "header"
>- Changed the content class to main element selector
>- Changed the benefit class to aside element selector
>- Merged the 3 seperate classes into a common class to remove duplicates, this was done a total of 6 times
>- Changed footer from a class to an element

## What problems does it solve?

These changes have been made to Horiseon's website in order for it to be more accessible, as it will appear in more Google searches than before.
Also, if someone were to look at the code for the HTML and CSS files, they will see comments explaining the changes that have been made to the code,
and what parts of the code do what.

## What did you learn?

Here is a list on the things that I learnt throughout this challenge:
>
>- What elements do and how they can be used to simplify code, instead of using classes or IDs for everything
>- How to make a repository, and then make and push changes from the feature branch to the main branch
>- How to deploy a site after committing and pushing up to the repository, making sure it's ready for the end-user
>- Making sure that the index.html file is outside of any folders so that it can be seen when the URL to the site is clicked
>- How alt attributes can make the site more accessible
>- How to simplify the CSS and HTML code through the use of element selectors
